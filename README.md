# Hi there! I'm Punjitha, aka algotyrnt. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student passionate about <b> DevOps, AI, and Software Development</b>. I love building innovative projects, breaking things to understand how they work, and occasionally diving deep into theoretical computer science rabbit holes.
<br><br>
Beyond development, I am strongly interested in research and development, especially in AI and quantum computing. I thrive on exploring cutting-edge technologies, experimenting with new ideas, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
<br><br>
When I'm not coding, you'll find me geeking out over psychology and cybersecurity, listening to audiobooks, or maybe just vibing to music.
