# Hi there! I'm Punjitha, aka algotyrnt. 👋

I'm a computer science undergraduate with a passion for turning ideas into reality. I enjoy breaking things to understand how they work and love exploring the deep rabbit holes of computer science.

Beyond that, I am deeply interested in research and development. I love exploring cutting-edge technologies, experimenting with new ideas, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me geeking out over a new TV series, vibing to music, or immersed in an audiobook.
