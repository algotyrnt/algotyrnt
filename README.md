# Hi there! I'm Punjitha, aka algotyrnt. 👋

I'm a computer science undergraduate with a passion for turning ideas into reality. I enjoy breaking things to understand how they work and and love exploring the deep rabbit holes of computer science.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me geeking out over a new TV series, vibing to music, or immersed in a book.
