# Hi there! I'm Punjitha, aka algotyrnt. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science undergraduate with a passion for turning ideas into powerful solutions. I love breaking things to understand how they work and often find myself diving deep into the rabbit holes of theoretical computer science.

Beyond development, I am strongly interested in research and development. I love exploring cutting-edge technologies, experimenting with new ideas, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me geeking out over a new TV series, vibing to music, or immersed in an audiobook.
